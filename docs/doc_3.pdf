SITE HISTORY AND CONTAMINATION SOURCES

Historical Site Operations: The subject property operated as an integrated chemical manufacturing complex from 1952 through 1998, producing specialty chemicals, industrial solvents, and polymer precursors. Manufacturing operations included multi-step chemical synthesis processes, solvent recovery and recycling systems, raw material storage and handling facilities, waste treatment and disposal areas, and product packaging and distribution operations.

Historical site investigations identify multiple potential contamination sources including underground storage tanks for raw materials and finished products, surface impoundments for process wastewater treatment, chemical storage and transfer areas with potential spill history, waste accumulation areas including drummed materials and solid residues, and former disposal areas including on-site landfills and burn pits.

Facility closure activities included removal of above-ground storage tanks and process equipment, closure of surface impoundments with material stabilization, and limited soil removal in known contamination areas. However, comprehensive environmental assessment was not conducted at closure, and subsurface contamination remained uncharacterized until recent investigations.

Regional geological and hydrogeological conditions include Piedmont metamorphic bedrock overlain by residual soils to depths of 15-25 feet, seasonal groundwater occurrence in weathered rock and soil interfaces, and surface water drainage toward Mill Creek located 800 meters to the southeast.

COMPREHENSIVE SITE INVESTIGATION

Phase II environmental site assessment activities included advancement of 185 soil borings to depths of 25 feet, installation of 35 monitoring wells for groundwater assessment, collection and analysis of 525 soil samples and 105 groundwater samples, and geophysical surveys to identify buried tanks and utilities.

Soil sampling followed systematic grid patterns with additional focused sampling in areas of known or suspected contamination. Sample collection utilized split-spoon sampling techniques with continuous logging of soil conditions, visual and olfactory observations, and field screening using portable analysis equipment.

Laboratory analytical programs included comprehensive analysis for volatile organic compounds using EPA Method 8260, semivolatile organic compounds using EPA Method 8270, petroleum hydrocarbons using EPA Method 8015, metals analysis using EPA Method 6010/7470, and specialized analyses for site-specific compounds including pesticides and PCBs.

Quality assurance programs included collection of duplicate samples (10% frequency), equipment blanks, trip blanks, and matrix spike/matrix spike duplicate analyses to verify analytical accuracy and precision. All analyses were performed by certified laboratories using EPA-approved methods with appropriate detection limits for risk assessment applications.

CONTAMINANT DISTRIBUTION AND CHARACTERIZATION

Heavy Metal Contamination Assessment: Metals contamination occurs in localized areas associated with former chemical storage and processing areas. Lead concentrations range from background levels of 15-25 mg/kg in unimpacted areas to maximum concentrations of 1,850 mg/kg in former battery processing areas, significantly exceeding residential and industrial screening levels.

Chromium contamination includes both trivalent and hexavalent forms with total chromium concentrations reaching 425 mg/kg in areas associated with metal plating operations. Hexavalent chromium, the more toxic form, occurs at maximum concentrations of 85 mg/kg requiring specialized treatment approaches.

Mercury contamination is localized to areas associated with chlor-alkali operations and instrument manufacturing, with concentrations ranging from background levels below 0.1 mg/kg to maximum concentrations of 12.4 mg/kg. Mercury contamination includes both inorganic mercury compounds and organic mercury species requiring different treatment approaches.

Arsenic contamination occurs throughout approximately 15 acres of the site with concentrations ranging from 8.5 mg/kg to 78 mg/kg. Arsenic contamination is associated with pesticide manufacturing operations and wood preservation activities, with contamination primarily in the pentavalent form requiring reduction treatment for stabilization.

Petroleum Hydrocarbon Impact Evaluation: Petroleum hydrocarbon contamination occurs in multiple areas associated with underground storage tanks, vehicle maintenance areas, and chemical storage facilities. Total petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations range from non-detect to maximum concentrations of 2,850 mg/kg in former tank farm areas.

Gasoline-range organics occur primarily in shallow soils (0-8 feet) with concentrations up to 485 mg/kg, while diesel-range organics extend to greater depths (0-15 feet) with maximum concentrations of 1,250 mg/kg. Oil-range organics show the greatest extent of contamination both laterally and vertically.

Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) compounds occur in groundwater at concentrations exceeding drinking water standards, with benzene reaching maximum concentrations of 1,250 μg/L and requiring active remediation to prevent migration.

Organic Chemical Contamination Analysis: Volatile organic compound contamination includes chlorinated solvents, aromatic compounds, and ketones associated with former manufacturing and cleaning operations. Trichloroethylene occurs at maximum soil concentrations of 125 mg/kg and groundwater concentrations of 2,850 μg/L, requiring active treatment and long-term monitoring.

COMPREHENSIVE RISK ASSESSMENT

Human Health Risk Evaluation: Quantitative human health risk assessment follows EPA risk assessment guidance incorporating exposure pathway analysis, toxicity assessment, and risk characterization for both cancer and non-cancer health endpoints. Risk assessment considers current conditions and future land use scenarios including industrial, commercial, and recreational uses.

Exposure pathway analysis identifies potential routes of human contact including direct soil contact through dermal absorption and incidental ingestion, inhalation of volatile compounds and particulate matter, and groundwater ingestion from potential future wells. Exposure parameters are based on EPA standard values with adjustments for site-specific conditions.

Cancer risk assessment incorporates EPA cancer slope factors for carcinogenic compounds including metals (arsenic, chromium VI), organic compounds (benzene, PAHs), and chlorinated solvents. Maximum individual lifetime cancer risk is calculated at 2.4 × 10⁻⁴ for current site conditions, exceeding EPA's target risk range of 10⁻⁶ to 10⁻⁴.

Ecological Risk Assessment: Comprehensive ecological risk assessment evaluates potential impacts to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems using EPA guidance for ecological risk assessment. Assessment endpoints include individual organisms, populations, and ecosystem-level effects for representative species.

Terrestrial ecological assessment identifies potential receptor species including plants, soil invertebrates, and wildlife utilizing the site. Soil screening indicates potential impacts to sensitive plant species from metals contamination, while bioaccumulation modeling suggests limited risks to wildlife given current site vegetation conditions.

REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGY EVALUATION

Excavation and Off-Site Disposal: Traditional excavation and off-site disposal represents the most straightforward remediation approach for high-concentration contamination areas. This approach is recommended for approximately 12,000 cubic yards of soil with metals concentrations exceeding treatment technology capabilities.

Excavation activities include removal of contaminated soil to specified depths, confirmation sampling to verify achievement of cleanup goals, backfilling with clean certified material, and site restoration to support planned redevelopment. Off-site disposal requires hazardous waste characterization and transport to appropriately licensed disposal facilities.

In-Situ Chemical Treatment: Advanced in-situ chemical treatment technologies offer cost-effective remediation for organic contamination while minimizing site disruption. Chemical oxidation using permanganate, persulfate, or ozone injection systems can achieve high treatment efficiency for petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents.

Bioremediation Technologies: Biological treatment approaches utilize natural or enhanced microbial processes to degrade organic contaminants in soil and groundwater. Enhanced biodegradation involves addition of nutrients, electron acceptors, or specialized microbial cultures to accelerate contaminant degradation rates.

Monitored natural attenuation relies on naturally occurring physical, chemical, and biological processes to reduce contaminant concentrations over time. This approach requires comprehensive monitoring to demonstrate contaminant reduction and ensure protection of receptors during the remediation timeframe.
