PROJECT WATER RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

The proposed manufacturing facility requires comprehensive water resource management addressing process water needs, sanitary waste management, stormwater collection and treatment, groundwater protection, and aquatic ecosystem preservation. Total facility water demand is estimated at 185,000 gallons per day for all operational requirements.

Process water requirements include high-purity water for manufacturing operations (45,000 gallons/day), cooling system makeup water (85,000 gallons/day), boiler feedwater and steam generation (25,000 gallons/day), fire suppression system reserves (15,000 gallons/day), and general facility maintenance and cleaning operations (15,000 gallons/day).

Water supply sources include connection to the regional municipal water system providing treated potable water meeting all applicable standards, on-site groundwater extraction from permitted wells with comprehensive monitoring protocols, recycled process water recovery systems achieving 65% water reuse efficiency, and rainwater harvesting systems for non-potable applications.

Wastewater generation includes process wastewater requiring specialized treatment (125,000 gallons/day), sanitary wastewater from employee facilities (8,500 gallons/day), cooling system blowdown with thermal and chemical treatment needs (45,000 gallons/day), and stormwater runoff from facility surfaces requiring quality management before discharge.

COMPREHENSIVE HYDROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT

Regional Watershed Characteristics: The project area is located within the Little River watershed, encompassing 1,250 square kilometers of mixed land use including forested areas (45%), agricultural lands (35%), urban and suburban development (15%), and industrial facilities (5%). The watershed exhibits typical temperate region hydrology with seasonal flow variations and moderate baseflow conditions.

Primary surface water features include the Little River main stem with average annual flow of 125 cubic feet per second, three major tributaries (North Branch, Mill Creek, and Sandy Run) contributing additional flow, numerous smaller streams and seasonal watercourses, constructed wetlands and retention ponds for flood control, and several small impoundments for water supply and recreation.

The Little River supports warm-water fisheries including bass, sunfish, catfish, and various minnow species. Aquatic habitat quality varies throughout the watershed with excellent conditions in forested headwater areas, good to moderate conditions in agricultural regions with proper management, and impaired conditions in some urbanized areas requiring restoration efforts.

Groundwater resources occur in multiple aquifer systems including the regional Piedmont fractured rock aquifer extending to depths of 200 feet, overlying weathered bedrock providing localized water supplies, and shallow alluvial deposits along stream corridors. Groundwater generally flows from upland areas toward stream valleys with discharge to surface water systems.

Seasonal Hydrological Patterns: Hydrological analysis based on 25 years of streamflow data shows distinct seasonal patterns with peak flows during late winter and early spring months (February through April), moderate flows during late spring and early summer periods (May through July), lowest flows during late summer and early autumn (August through October), and variable winter flows depending on precipitation and temperature patterns.

Average monthly flows range from 45 cubic feet per second during dry summer periods to 285 cubic feet per second during peak spring runoff events. Extreme flow conditions include 7-day low flows of 12 cubic feet per second (10-year recurrence) and peak flood flows reaching 2,850 cubic feet per second (100-year recurrence) based on statistical analysis of historical data.

WATER QUALITY BASELINE CONDITIONS

Comprehensive water quality monitoring conducted monthly for 24 months at fifteen locations throughout the watershed provides detailed baseline characterization of existing conditions. Surface water quality parameters generally meet state water quality standards with some localized impairments in urbanized areas.

Physical and chemical parameters show pH levels ranging from 6.5 to 7.8 (within acceptable ranges), dissolved oxygen concentrations from 6.8 to 11.2 mg/L (adequate for aquatic life support), total suspended solids averaging 12 mg/L with seasonal variations, and conductivity levels from 125 to 285 Î¼S/cm indicating moderate mineral content.

Nutrient concentrations include total nitrogen ranging from 0.8 to 2.1 mg/L, total phosphorus from 0.05 to 0.15 mg/L, and nitrate-nitrogen from 0.2 to 1.2 mg/L. These levels indicate generally good water quality with some areas showing elevated nutrients from agricultural and urban sources requiring continued management attention.

Heavy metal and organic compound analyses show concentrations below detection limits for most parameters, with occasional low-level detections of common urban pollutants including copper, zinc, and petroleum hydrocarbons at concentrations well below harmful levels for aquatic life or human health.

Groundwater quality analysis shows generally excellent conditions with pH from 6.2 to 7.5, low dissolved solids content (150-320 mg/L), negligible organic contamination, and heavy metal concentrations below detection limits. Some wells show elevated iron and manganese concentrations typical of regional geological conditions but not indicating contamination.

DETAILED IMPACT ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT

Surface Water Impact Evaluation: Facility operations will generate process wastewater requiring advanced treatment before discharge to the regional water system. Treated effluent will meet or exceed all applicable National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit requirements and state water quality standards.

Advanced wastewater treatment systems include primary clarification for solids removal, biological treatment using membrane bioreactor technology achieving high-efficiency organic matter removal, tertiary filtration and disinfection for pathogen elimination, and advanced oxidation processes for trace organic compound destruction.

Treated effluent quality will consistently achieve biochemical oxygen demand less than 10 mg/L, total suspended solids less than 5 mg/L, total nitrogen less than 8 mg/L, total phosphorus less than 1 mg/L, and pH maintained between 6.5 and 8.5. These discharge limits represent substantial improvement over current regional discharge standards.

Groundwater Impact Assessment: Groundwater protection measures include comprehensive monitoring well networks, leak detection systems for all process areas, secondary containment for all chemical storage and handling areas, and groundwater remediation contingency planning with financial assurance mechanisms.

Groundwater flow modeling using MODFLOW software indicates that potential contaminant releases would be contained within the facility property boundaries due to groundwater flow patterns, engineered barriers, and monitoring system designs. Groundwater travel times to the nearest water supply well exceed 15 years, providing extensive opportunity for detection and remediation if needed.

Aquatic Ecosystem Impact Analysis: Comprehensive aquatic ecological assessment includes fish community surveys, benthic macroinvertebrate sampling, habitat quality evaluation, and ecosystem services analysis. Baseline conditions show diverse aquatic communities with good habitat quality in most areas.

Fish community analysis identifies 23 species including game fish (largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, bluegill, channel catfish), forage species (various minnows and darters), and sensitive species indicating good water quality conditions. No threatened or endangered aquatic species were identified in the study area.

COMPREHENSIVE MITIGATION AND ENHANCEMENT MEASURES

Advanced Water Treatment Technologies: State-of-the-art wastewater treatment facilities incorporate multiple treatment processes achieving effluent quality exceeding regulatory requirements and approaching potable water standards for many parameters.

Primary treatment includes screening and grit removal, equalization basins for flow and load smoothing, chemical precipitation for phosphorus removal, and primary clarification achieving 85% suspended solids removal and 35% biochemical oxygen demand reduction.

Secondary biological treatment utilizes membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology combining conventional activated sludge processes with ultrafiltration membranes. MBR systems achieve greater than 99% removal of suspended solids, 95% removal of biochemical oxygen demand, 90% removal of total nitrogen through nitrification-denitrification, and effective removal of pathogens and trace organic compounds.

Stormwater Management Systems: Comprehensive stormwater management incorporates green infrastructure principles, advanced treatment technologies, and ecosystem restoration approaches to manage runoff quantity and quality while providing environmental co-benefits.

Green infrastructure components include extensive bioswales and rain gardens for initial runoff treatment, permeable pavement systems reducing runoff volume by 40%, green roof systems on facility buildings providing additional retention, constructed wetlands for advanced biological treatment, and riparian buffer restoration enhancing natural filtration.

MONITORING AND COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK

Surface Water Monitoring Programs: Comprehensive surface water monitoring includes continuous monitoring of discharge flow rates and key water quality parameters, monthly sampling and analysis of comprehensive parameter suites, quarterly biological monitoring including fish and macroinvertebrate communities, and annual whole effluent toxicity testing ensuring ecological protection.

Groundwater Monitoring Networks: Extensive groundwater monitoring networks include 15 monitoring wells positioned to provide comprehensive coverage of potential impact areas. Wells are sampled quarterly for comprehensive analytical suites including conventional parameters, facility-specific compounds, and early warning indicators.
